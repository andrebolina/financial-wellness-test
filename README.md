# Financial Wellness Test

This project is the <a href="https://www.bolina.dev">Andr√© Bolina</a> implementation of the take-home assignment (THA) for the <em>Fullstack Software Engineer | Investment's Team role</em> at <a href="https://www.useorigin.com">Origin</a>.

The THA proposal is create a web interface and an API application for a financial wellness test based on user's input for his annual gross income and average monthly costs. <a href="https://useorigin.notion.site/THA-Web-Interface-API-application-4819947101684706b984f04e9aef9294">Click here</a> to access the fully THA doc.

## Technology Stack
The THA doesn't have a required technology stack for his development. I've decided to use Python + React, since it's has been my day to day stack at least for the past year.

## API
### Development notes
I've decided to use Flask instead a heavy-weight framework since we currently have just a few requirements and business rules. Flask provide speed and flexibility without complexy, it requires requires much fewer lines of code for a task like that. Althought light-weight, Flask is an extensible solutions and would support the API growth. I think the key points to change to a heavy-weight (e.g. Django) would be the requirements for authentication, database connection and team growth (to keep patterns easier).

Also, I've decided to use Marshmallow since it provides more control of API request and response schemas with a thin integration layer, ensuring the frontend contracts fulfillment.

### Requirements
In order to run the API you should have Python, PIP and Pipenv installed. All commands bellow are suppossed to be runned into `server` folder and requires npm installed*.

<em>* You can check the final scripts into <strong>server/packages.json</strong> to execute them without npm.</em>
### `npm run setup`
Create a virtual environment for the project and install all dependencies, including dev ones.

### `npm start`
Runs the flask api in the development mode.\
The API will run on <a href="http://localhost:5000">http://localhost:5000</a>.

### `npm test`
Runs the unit tests.

### `npm run coverage`
Runs the unit tests coverage.

## Web Interface
### Development notes
I've decided to use Create React App (CRA)..

I've decided to create my own components instead use a third-party library (e.g. Material-UI) since we have a own UI style. Therefore, it would require a lot of classes/styles override in the library components. Creating my own components I've reached in same result with a smaller bundle size, providing smooth maintenances (less broken updates and conflicts with another libraries) and turning it easier to be incorpored on another project.

I've decided to use component wrapper ...

I've decided to use a lot of dev dependencies ...


### Requirements
In order to run the Web Interface you should have Node.js and npm installed. All commands bellow are suppossed to be runned into `client` folder.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run coverage`
Launches the test runner with coverage results in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run format`
Format js, jsx, and css project files according to prettier config.

### `npm run lint`
Check js and jsx project files according to Eslint config.


### `npm run lint:fix`
Format js and jsx project files according to to Eslint config.
